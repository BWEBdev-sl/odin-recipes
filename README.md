# odin-recipes

Hello everyone! today after going on for a little while in my odin web dev journey, I have come to a major checkpoint, my first assignment!

I got to know about a certain few useful HTML tags and using them I have to make a simple recipe website as mentioned in the assignment description in the Odin website.

I will be using the tags taught previously and nothing more than it to make this assignment a success!

Good luck
