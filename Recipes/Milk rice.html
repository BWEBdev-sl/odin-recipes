        <h3><u>Description</u></h3>
        <p>
            <b>Kiri Bath</b>, or milk rice, is a traditional Sri Lankan dish made by cooking rice with coconut milk to create a rich, creamy texture. It holds deep cultural significance and is often prepared for special occasions, including Sinhala and Tamil New Year, weddings, and religious ceremonies. The dish symbolizes prosperity and new beginnings, making it a must-have for auspicious events. Its origins trace back centuries, influenced by Sri Lankaâ€™s deep-rooted rice cultivation and use of coconut in cooking. Kiri Bath is typically served with spicy accompaniments like lunu miris (a chili and onion sambol) or sweet treats like jaggery, offering a perfect balance of flavors.

        <h4>Steps for kiri bath</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Rinse the rice thoroughly in water until the water runs clear.</li>
            <li>In a large pot, add the rinsed rice and enough water to cook it (about 1.5 to 2 cups of water per cup of rice).</li>
            <li>Bring the rice and water to a boil, then reduce the heat and simmer until the rice is fully cooked and the water is absorbed.</li>
            <li>Add the coconut milk to the cooked rice and stir well to combine.</li>
            <li>Add salt to taste and stir in sugar if you prefer a slightly sweet flavor.</li>
            <li>Simmer the rice on low heat for another 5-10 minutes, allowing the coconut milk to fully absorb and create a creamy consistency.</li>
            <li>Optional: Add ghee or butter for a richer flavor.</li>
            <li>Once the rice has reached a thick, creamy consistency, remove from heat and serve hot.</li>
            <li>Traditionally, kiri bath is cut into squares and served with lunu miris or sweet treats like jaggery.</li>

            <li>Finely chop the red onions and green chilies.</li>
            <li>If using Maldivian fish, crush it into small pieces using a mortar and pestle or your hands.</li>
