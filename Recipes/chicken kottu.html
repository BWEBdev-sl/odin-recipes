        <h3><u>Description</u></h3>
        <p>
            <b>Chicken Kottu</b> is a popular Sri Lankan street food dish made by stir-frying shredded Godhamba roti (a type of flatbread) with chicken, vegetables, eggs, and a blend of aromatic spices. It is often served with a side of spicy curry or gravy for added flavor. Kottu originated in Sri Lanka in the late 20th century as a creative way to use leftover roti, and it has since become a beloved comfort food across the country. The dish is known for its signature rhythmic chopping sound, as vendors skillfully mix and chop the ingredients on a hot griddle using metal blades.
