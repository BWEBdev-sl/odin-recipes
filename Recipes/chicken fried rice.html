    <h3><u>Description</u></h3>
    <p>
        <b>Chicken Fried Rice </b>is a popular dish in Sri Lanka, loved for its rich flavors and versatility. Originating from Chinese cuisine, it has been adapted to suit Sri Lankan tastes with spicier ingredients like chili flakes, pepper, and curry leaves. Often served with devilled chicken, chili paste (katta sambol), and vegetable chop suey, it is a favorite meal for both everyday dining and special occasions. Whether enjoyed at restaurants, street food stalls, or home-cooked feasts, Sri Lankans relish their fried rice with bold,
         aromatic flavors that make it a satisfying and comforting dish.
